### 📊 Project Focus: 
Delivering valuable business insights to senior management at AtliQ Hardwares, a fictional yet forward-thinking computer hardware brand with a strong footprint in India and globally.

### 🔎 The Challenge:
AtliQ Hardwares faced a key hurdle—limited access to timely and actionable data. In response, their Director of Data Analytics, Tony Sharma, launched a hands-on SQL challenge to assess the analytical and communication skills of aspiring junior analysts.

### 🎯 Goal:
Use SQL to solve 10 specific business queries related to sales, pricing trends, and inventory performance, and visualize findings in Power BI to guide effective decision-making.

### 💡 Key Learnings & Skills Gained:
✔️ SQL Joins – Merged datasets to gain deeper insights into market and sales patterns.
✔️ Filtering & Grouping – Extracted and grouped key metrics using WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING.
✔️ Aggregation – Applied SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() to summarize critical KPIs.
✔️ Power BI Integration – Translated insights into clear and interactive visualizations.
✔️ CTEs – Streamlined and structured complex logic for easier interpretation.
✔️ Window Functions – Used RANK() and similar tools to identify top-performing products.

### 📊 Key Insights Uncovered:
📌 Unique products grew by 36.33% from 2020 to 2021.
📌 Retailer channel led with ₹1219M+, contributing 73% of gross sales.
📌 Accessories had the highest product variety growth.
📌 Flipkart topped the average discount chart in India.
📌 Q1 2020 recorded the highest sales volume.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
💡 Business context is essential — SQL is just a tool.
💡 Clean queries are great, but clean communication is greater.
💡 Executives don’t need code; they need clarity and impact.
💡 Simplicity, structure, and storytelling win over technical complexity.

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:
🔹 SQL (Joins, Aggregates, CTEs, Window Functions).
🔹 Business Insight Articulation.
